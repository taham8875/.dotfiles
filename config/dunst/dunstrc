[shortcuts]

# Every section that isn't one of the above is interpreted as a rules to
# override settings for certain messages.
#
# Messages can be matched by "appname", "summary", "body", "icon", "urgency",
# "category", "msg_urgency" and "msg_category" and you can override the
# "timeout", "urgency", "foreground", "background", "new_foreground",
# "new_background", "frame_color", "format" and "icon".
#
# Shell-like globbing will work if "*", "?" and "[]" are used for matching.
#
# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run whenever a rule matches by
# setting the "script" option.
#
# The script will be called as follows:
#   script appname summary body icon urgency category
#           ^       ^       ^    ^    ^        ^
#           |       |       |    |    |        |
#          \_/     \_/     \_/  \_/  \_/      \_/
#          The parameters are wrapped in quotes and passed on
#          to the script as strings
#
# NOTE: if you don't want to allow more than one of these, just comment the keyword "script".
#       If the script, returns a non-zero exit code, the notification will not be displayed.
#
# EXAMPLE: Print the summary of all notifications from vlc to the console.
#
#[vlc]
#    summary = "*"
#    script = echo "$1"
